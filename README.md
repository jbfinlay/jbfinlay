## Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 causes profound changes in the sense of smell, including total smell loss.
While these alterations are often transient, many COVID-19 patients exhibit olfactory
dysfunction that lasts months to years. Although animal and human autopsy studies
have suggested mechanisms driving acute anosmia, it remains unclear how SARSCoV-
2 causes persistent smell loss in a subset of patients. To address this question,
here we analyze olfactory epithelial samples derived from patients suffering from
objectively quantified long-term smell loss following COVID-19. This biopsy-based
approach reveals a diffuse infiltrate of T cells expressing interferon-gamma, and a
myeloid cell shift including enrichment of CD207+ dendritic cells and depletion of antiinflammatory
M2 macrophages. Despite the absence of detectible SARS-CoV-2 RNA or
protein, gene expression in sustentacular cells appears to reflect a response to ongoing
inflammatory signaling, which is accompanied by a reduction in the number of olfactory
sensory neurons relative to support cells. These data suggest that T-cell mediated
inflammation persists in the olfactory epithelium long after the virus has been eliminated
from the tissue, identify a mechanism underlying long-term post-COVID smell loss, and
raise the possibility that sterile epithelial infiltration by immune cells participates in other
long COVID symptoms.
